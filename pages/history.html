                    the Rolling Stones, British rock group, formed in 1962, that drew on Chicago blues stylings to create a unique 
                    vision of the dark side of post-1960s counterculture. The original members were Mick Jagger (b. July 26, 1943,
                    Dartford, Kent, England), Keith Richards (b. December 18, 1943, Dartford), Brian Jones (b. February 28, 1942, 
                    Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England—d. July 3, 1969, Hartfield, Sussex, England), Bill Wyman (b. October 24, 
                    1936, London, England), and Charlie Watts (b. June 2, 1941, London—d. August 24, 2021, London). Later members 
                    were Mick Taylor (b. January 17, 1948, Hereford, East Hereford and Worcester, England), Ron Wood (b. June 1, 
                    1947, London), and Darryl Jones (b. December 11, 1961, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.).
                    No rock band has sustained consistent activity and global popularity for so long a period as the Rolling Stones,
                    still capable, more than 50 years after their formation, of filling the largest stadia in the world. Though several 
                    of their mid-1960s contemporaries—notably Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, and Van Morrison—have maintained
                     individual positions in rock’s front line, the Rolling Stones’ nucleus of singer Jagger, guitarist Richards, and
                      drummer Watts remains rock’s most durable ongoing partnership.
